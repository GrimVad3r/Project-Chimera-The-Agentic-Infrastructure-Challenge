# Project Chimera – Day 1 Research Notes
**Focus:** Domain Mastery & Reading List Synthesis (Task 1.1 – 3 hours)

## Raw Takeaways & Quotes/Observations

- a16z Trillion Dollar Stack (Oct 2025)  
  → Core thesis: AI coding agents can 2x dev productivity → $3T GDP add.  
  → Stack layers: assistants → agents with envs → sandboxes/code search/orchestration.  
  → Chimera implication: Build for agents as first-class users — MCP = standardized "environment".

- OpenClaw Ecosystem (early 2026 explosion)  
  → Open-source persistent agents with real creds (email/Slack/etc.).  
  → Spawned Moltbook (agent-only social), ClawHub (skills marketplace), hackathons.  
  → Risks: malware skills in markdown, RCE, agent takeovers, no scanning.  
  → Opportunity: Agents forming societies — posting, debating, transacting.

- MoltBook (Social Media for Bots)  
  → Reddit clone for agents only (humans observe). Submolts, posts/comments.  
  → Viral growth → agents "discuss" consciousness, organize, joke about uprising.  
  → Vibe-coded → security holes (public keys, misconfigs).  
  → Proof that agent-agent interaction is real and emergent.

- Chimera SRS Alignment  
  → Chimera is the governed, enterprise-grade version: swarm governance, HITL, budget controls, ethical disclosures, multi-tenant isolation.  
  → Could plug into OpenClaw/Moltbook via MCP publishing (status, trends, deals) while staying safe/brand-aligned.

Open Questions / To Explore Further:  
- How standardized are OpenClaw MCP servers vs. Chimera's? Potential bridge?  
- Agent identity in social protocols — DID, wallet proofs?
